Welcome to the "Learning Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design with Python" repository! This README showcases my educational journey in mastering these essential topics during a university class where Python was the primary programming language.

## Introduction
This repository documents my experiences and progress in understanding data structures and object-oriented design as taught in a university class. Throughout the course, we explored the principles, implementations, and applications of data structures and OOD, using Python to bring these concepts to life.

## University Course Overview
### Course Objectives
The course aimed to equip us with a strong foundation in data structures and OOD, preparing us for real-world software development challenges. The key learning objectives were:

- Understanding common data structures and their operations.
- Applying object-oriented principles to design and model software systems.
- Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms involving data structures.
- Implementing practical projects using Python to solidify our knowledge.

### Learning Approach
The class followed a structured approach, balancing theoretical lectures with hands-on coding exercises and projects. The curriculum was designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of Python's capabilities.

## Topics Covered
### Data Structures
We covered a wide range of data structures, including:

- Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs (Undirected and Directed)
For each data structure, we learned about its characteristics, advantages, and usage scenarios. We analyzed the time and space complexities of essential operations to gain insights into their efficiency.

### Object-Oriented Design
The class emphasized the importance of object-oriented design in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code. We explored the following concepts:

- Classes, Objects, and Methods
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- SOLID Principles
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, and more)
In practical sessions, we designed object-oriented systems to model real-world scenarios, encouraging us to think in terms of objects and their interactions.

## Projects and Assignments
Throughout the course, we worked on several programming assignments and projects to apply our knowledge. These projects challenged us to design software solutions using appropriate data structures and OOD principles. Some of the projects included:

- Implementing a contact management system using linked lists.
- Designing a binary search tree for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- Building a social network graph with friend recommendation functionality.
- Applying design patterns to develop a customizable text-based game.

## Conclusion
The university class on "Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design with Python" has been an enlightening and enriching experience. I now possess a strong understanding of Python, data structures, and object-oriented design, providing a solid foundation for my future endeavors in software development.

I am grateful for the guidance and support of my professors and fellow classmates, who made this learning journey enjoyable and rewarding.
